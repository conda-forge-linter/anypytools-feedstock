  description: |
    AnyPyTools is a toolkit for working with the AnyBody Modeling System (AMS) 
    from Python. Its main purpose is to launch AnyBody simulations and collect 
    results. It has a scheduler to launch multiple instances of AMS utilising 
    computers with multiple cores. AnyPyTools makes it possible to run parameter 
    and Monte Carlo studies more efficiently than from within AMS.
